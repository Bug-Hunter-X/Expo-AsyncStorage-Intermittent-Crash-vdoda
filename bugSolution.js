The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and logging when interacting with AsyncStorage. We will use try...catch blocks to handle potential exceptions and log errors to the console, providing crucial information for debugging.  Additionally, we may use a more robust storage solution if the problem persists, such as SQLite or MMKV.
